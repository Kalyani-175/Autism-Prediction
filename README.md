Autism Predictions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting autism tendencies using machine learning techniques.
It explores data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection, and classification models to assist in early autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Multiple machine learning models for autism prediction

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Easy-to-run notebook format

📂 Repository Structure
├── Autism_Predictions.ipynb   # Main notebook with code and analysis

⚙️ Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/autism-predictions.git
cd autism-predictions


Install dependencies (create a virtual environment if needed):

pip install -r requirements.txt


(If requirements.txt is missing, you can install common packages manually: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.)

▶️ Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Autism_Predictions.ipynb


Run the cells step by step to:

Load and explore the dataset

Train machine learning models

Evaluate predictions

📊 Dataset

The notebook uses autism screening datasets.

Make sure the dataset file is available in the working directory or update the file path inside the notebook.
